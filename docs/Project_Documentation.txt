Project Documentation: RevoltransThis comprehensive documentation provides an overview of Revoltrans, a Logistics Management System. It is designed for frontend developers, UI/UX designers, and technical teams to facilitate smooth integration with backend functionality. The documentation will be divided into Core Business Flows, Frontend Interaction Flows, Frontend UI Components, and API Documentation.1. Core Business FlowsThe Core Business Flows describe the overall user journeys from the perspective of business operations. These flows lay the foundation for how customers, vendors, drivers, and admins interact with the system at a higher level, focusing on system interactions rather than individual screen designs.Client Journey* User Registration: Customers begin by registering an account, providing essential details such as their username, email, phone number, and password.* Transport Request: Once registered, customers can submit transport requests by specifying the origin, destination, transport type, and journey date.* Journey Completion & Payment: After the transport service has been completed, the customer reviews the journey details and confirms payment.* Journey History & Analytics: Customers can track previous journeys, view payment status, and access journey statistics via an analytics dashboard.Vendor Journey* Onboarding: Vendors create accounts by submitting details related to their business, such as company name, tax ID, and registration date. Once submitted, the vendor awaits admin approval.* Transport Request Management: Vendors are able to view incoming transport requests, accept or reject them, and assign drivers to specific requests.* Waybill Documentation: After accepting a transport request, the vendor uploads the waybill documentation to the system, ensuring all necessary transport information is recorded securely on AWS S3.* Analytics Dashboard: Vendors can monitor their performance and statistics, such as completed journeys and payments, through an interactive analytics dashboard.Driver Journey* Driver Onboarding & Verification: Drivers are onboarded in a similar manner to vendors, providing personal and verification details. Their account is then verified by the admin.* Journey Assignment: Once approved, drivers are assigned to specific transport journeys and are responsible for confirming the journey status.* Journey Status Updates: Drivers update the status of their assigned journeys (e.g., "in-progress", "completed") and document any issues (e.g., damage, rejection of goods).* Payment Confirmation: After successfully completing a transport service, drivers confirm receipt of payment through the system.Admin Journey* User Registration Management: Admins oversee the approval and rejection of vendor and driver registrations, ensuring the proper onboarding of service providers.* Payment and Expense Processing: Admins review and approve payment requests submitted by vendors and drivers. Payment reconciliation is handled through the admin interface.* Analytics & Reporting: Admins can access system-wide analytics and generate reports on journey statistics, payment processing, and user performance.2. Frontend Interaction FlowsThe Frontend Interaction Flows describe in detail how users will interact with the application on the front-end level, including specific screen layouts, actions, and design suggestions. These interactions are aligned with the core business flows, but focus on how the user experience will be structured and presented visually.Customer Interaction FlowRegistration/Login* Screen: User registration form with fields for username, email, phone number, and password.* Action: The user submits the registration form, triggering the system to send a verification code via SMS to their phone.* Verification: The user enters the verification code, and the system generates a JWT token for authenticated access.* Design Suggestion: Clean, minimalistic design with grey background. Input fields should be clearly defined, with error messages highlighted in red for validation feedback.Request Transport Service* Screen: Transport request form with fields for origin, destination, transport type, and journey date.* Action: The user selects the origin, destination, transport type (e.g., truck, car), and preferred time for the journey.* Design Suggestion: Dropdowns for origin and destination, a date picker for the journey date, and radio buttons or checkboxes for transport preferences. Ensure the form is simple and intuitive.Journey History & Analytics* Screen: Journey history dashboard that lists previous journeys, including details such as date, payment status, and route.* Action: The user views completed journeys and can filter or search based on date or status.* Design Suggestion: Use a grey background with a clean, table-style layout. Each row should display essential information, with color-coding for payment status (e.g., green for paid, red for unpaid).Review Completed Journey & Payment* Screen: Journey completion page displaying detailed journey information.* Action: The user reviews the completed journey details and confirms payment.* Design Suggestion: Use a card-style layout with detailed transport information. Include a large payment button, and upon confirmation, show a modal for payment confirmation with a grey background.Vendor Interaction FlowOnboarding & Registration* Screen: Vendor registration form where vendors submit business details such as company name, tax ID, and business license.* Action: The vendor fills in company information and waits for admin approval.* Design Suggestion: A simple, structured form with clear input fields and progress indicators showing the registration stages.Manage Transport Requests* Screen: Vendor transport request dashboard.* Action: Vendors can accept or reject incoming transport requests and assign drivers to specific journeys.* Design Suggestion: A list of requests with status indicators (e.g., "new request", "assigned") and action buttons for accepting or rejecting.Upload Waybill Documentation* Screen: Waybill upload page for vendors to upload transport documentation.* Action: Vendors drag and drop the waybill documents or select files for upload.* Design Suggestion: Use a grey-toned drag-and-drop upload section, with a clean button to submit documents.Analytics Dashboard* Screen: Vendor analytics dashboard displaying performance metrics.* Action: Vendors can view completed journeys, payments, and other performance data.* Design Suggestion: Interactive charts (e.g., bar or pie charts) with grey backgrounds and visually engaging data visualization tools.Driver Interaction FlowOnboarding & Verification* Screen: Driver registration form similar to the vendor registration form, with fields for personal details and document uploads.* Action: The driver submits the form, and their account is verified by the admin.* Design Suggestion: Simple and clean grey form with progress indicators and clear error validation.Journey Assignment* Screen: A dashboard showing upcoming journey assignments.* Action: The driver views assigned journeys and has the option to accept or decline.* Design Suggestion: A list view with journey details (date, route, status), and action buttons for accepting or rejecting the assignment.Journey Status Update* Screen: Delivery status update page.* Action: The driver selects the status (e.g., "in-progress", "completed") from a dropdown or radio button and submits the update.* Design Suggestion: Dropdowns or radio buttons with a prominent "Update Status" button. Ensure a smooth, simple user experience.Payment Confirmation* Screen: Payment confirmation page.* Action: After completing a transport journey, the driver confirms receipt of payment.* Design Suggestion: Grey background with a simple layout confirming payment details and a button for confirmation.Admin Interaction FlowUser Registration Management* Screen: Admin user management dashboard.* Action: Admin reviews vendor and driver registrations, accepting or rejecting them based on verification.* Design Suggestion: A list view of users with action buttons for approval and rejection. Color-coding for status (approved/rejected).Payment & Expense Processing* Screen: Payment and expense processing page.* Action: Admin approves or denies payment and expense requests submitted by vendors and drivers.* Design Suggestion: A table-style layout displaying payment requests, with color-coded statuses and action buttons.Analytics & Reporting* Screen: Admin analytics dashboard.* Action: Admin accesses system-wide data, including journey statistics, payment reports, and user activity metrics.* Design Suggestion: Use charts and graphs to display data, with grey-toned backgrounds and color-coded data for easy analysis.3.
